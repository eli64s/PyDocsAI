## 📍 Overview

The mlops-course codebase is a comprehensive project aimed at providing a hands-on learning experience for MLOps (Machine Learning Operations). The project focuses on demonstrating various aspects of MLOps, including model development, deployment, monitoring, and optimization. By leveraging popular libraries and frameworks such as Hyperopt, MLflow, PyTorch, and Transformers, the codebase enables users to explore and implement essential MLOps practices. The project's value proposition lies in its ability to guide developers in understanding the end-to-end process of operationalizing machine learning models, thus bridging the gap between research and production-ready systems.

## 📦 Features

|    | Feature          | Description                                                                                                       |
|----|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**   | The codebase follows a modular architecture, with separate directories for different components such as data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. It uses a pipeline-based approach for training and deploying machine learning models. The architecture supports scalability and easy maintenance.                                                                                        |
| 📄 | **Documentation** | The codebase includes detailed and comprehensive documentation. Each component has its own README file explaining its purpose, usage, and dependencies. The README files also provide clear instructions on how to set up and run the code. Overall, the documentation is of high quality and helps developers understand and contribute to the project easily.                                                   |
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**  | The codebase has several external dependencies like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Flask, and Docker. These libraries are used for machine learning, data preprocessing, web application development, and containerization. The dependencies are well-managed using a requirements.txt file, making it easy to install and manage them.                                                      |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | The codebase is highly modular, with each component separated into its own directory. This modularity enables easy development and testing of individual components. The codebase follows best practices for code organization and separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the system.                                                                          |
| 🧪 | **Testing**       | The codebase includes unit tests for some of the components, like data preprocessing and model training. However, the overall test coverage is limited. The tests use frameworks like pytest and TensorFlow's built-in testing utilities. There is potential for expanding the test coverage to ensure the reliability and stability of the system.                                     |
| ⚡️ | **Performance**   | The performance of the system largely depends on the machine learning models and their training process. The codebase provides efficient data preprocessing techniques, parallel model training, and optimization options like GPU utilization. However, the specific performance characteristics may vary depending on the dataset and model used.                                                 |
| 🔐 | **Security**      | The codebase does not explicitly address security concerns, as it primarily focuses on machine learning operations. However, precautions can be taken during the deployment phase, such as implementing authentication, authorization, and secure communication protocols to protect the system and its data.                                                                    |
| 🔀 | **Version Control**| The codebase uses Git for version control and is hosted on GitHub. The use of Git allows for effective collaboration, easy code sharing, and version tracking. The repository has a clean commit history with descriptive commit messages, making it easy to understand the development progress and changes made to the codebase over time.
