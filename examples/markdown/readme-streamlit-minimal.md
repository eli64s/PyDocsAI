##  Overview

The readme-ai-streamlit project is a Streamlit-based tool that simplifies the generation of README files for software projects. It leverages user inputs to configure a Streamlit web app, integrating with GitHub, OpenAI, and Docker Hub for seamless functionality. Key files like Makefile and pyproject.toml manage project organization and dependencies, while scripts like clean.sh ensure repository cleanliness. The app.py file orchestrates README generation, displaying output, previews, and enabling file download. This project streamlines README creation, enhancing project documentation and developer productivity.
