## 👾 Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | The project follows a modular architecture with a CLI tool for README generation and a Streamlit web app for AI-based README generation. It uses Python for backend logic and Streamlit for the frontend. |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | The codebase maintains high code quality standards with consistent formatting and linting using tools like Ruff. It follows best practices for Python development and includes a Makefile for automation tasks. |
| 📄 | **Documentation** | The project has detailed documentation in the form of comments in the codebase and a README file. It explains the project structure, setup instructions, and usage guidelines for developers. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**  | Key integrations include README AI library for AI-based README generation, Streamlit for web app development, and Poetry for dependency management. External dependencies like Ruff are used for code formatting and linting. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | The codebase is modular and reusable, with separate modules for CLI functionality, utility functions, and the Streamlit web app. This design allows for easy maintenance and extension of the project. |
| 🧪 | **Testing**       | Testing frameworks and tools are not explicitly mentioned in the repository contents. However, the project can benefit from incorporating testing frameworks like pytest for automated testing. |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | The project's efficiency is enhanced by using AI for README generation and Streamlit for interactive web app development. Resource usage is optimized for generating README files based on user inputs. |
| 🛡️ | **Security**      | Security measures for data protection and access control are not explicitly mentioned in the repository contents. Implementing secure coding practices and data encryption can enhance the project's security. |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**  | Key external libraries and dependencies include README AI, Streamlit, Poetry for dependency management, and Ruff for code formatting and linting. These dependencies streamline development and enhance project functionality. |
| 🚀 | **Scalability**   | The project's architecture and design support scalability for handling increased traffic and load. The use of Streamlit for web app development allows for easy scaling of the AI-based README generation functionality. |
