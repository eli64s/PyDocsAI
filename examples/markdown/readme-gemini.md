| [readmeai.py](https://github.com/eli64s/readme-ai/blob/master/readmeai/readmeai.py)     | This code orchestrates the generation of a README file based on user inputs and configuration. It interacts with a language model to generate summaries, overviews, and slogans that enhance the READMEs content. The code reads from a user-specified repository, processes dependencies, and incorporates user-provided customization options to craft a tailored README.         |
| [exceptions.py](https://github.com/eli64s/readme-ai/blob/master/readmeai/exceptions.py) | This Python code defines a set of custom exception classes for the Readme-AI application. It encompasses exceptions for issues encountered during CLI operations, Git cloning and validation, file system operations (read and write errors), readme generation, and unsupported LLM services. These exceptions are used to handle errors and provide meaningful messages to users. |
